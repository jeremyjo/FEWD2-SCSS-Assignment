            <h1>Statistics / Data</h1>
            <p>Alex Honnold is the only person to free solo El Capitan in Yosemite National Park</p>

            <p>He climbed the 3,000 feet granite wall without any ropes or safety gear.</p>

            <p>It is widely recognized as the "greatest feat of pure rock climbing in the history of the sport."</p>

            <p>He ascended the peak in 3 hours, 56 minutes, taking the final moderate pitch at a near run. </p>
            
            <p>Alex began the climb 5:30am and at 9:28 a.m., under a blue sky and few wisps of cloud, he pulled his body over the rocky lip of summit and stood on a sandy ledge the size of a child’s bedroom.</p>

       

            <p>El Capitan is considered by many to be the epicenter of the rock climbing world. It is a vertical expanse stretching more than a half mile up—higher than the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. </p>

            <p>From the meadow at the foot of El Capitan, climbers on the peak’s upper reaches are practically invisible to the naked eye.</p>

            <p>“What Alex did on Moonlight Buttress defied everything that we are trained, and brought up and genetically engineered to think,” said Peter Mortimer, a climber who has made numerous films with Honnold. “It’s the most unnatural place for a human to be.”</p>

            <p>“This is the ‘moon landing’ of free soloing,” said Tommy Caldwell, who made his own history in 2015 with his ascent of the Dawn Wall, El Capitan’s most difficult climb, on which he and his partner Kevin Jorgeson used ropes and other equipment only for safety, not to aid their progress.</p>

            <p>Alex Honnold said "With free-soloing, obviously I know that I’m in danger, but feeling fearful while I’m up there is not helping me in any way."</p>

            <p>Climbers have been speculating for years about a possible free solo of El Capitan, but there have only been two other people who have publicly said they seriously considered it. One was Michael Reardon, a free soloist who drowned in 2007 after being swept from a ledge below a sea cliff in Ireland. The other was Dean Potter, who died in a base jumping accident in Yosemite in 2015.</p>

            <p>John Bachar, the greatest free soloist of the 1970s, who died while climbing un-roped in 2009 at age 52, never considered it. When Bachar was in his prime, El Capitan had still never been free climbed. Peter Croft, 58, who completed the landmark free solo of the 1980s—Yosemite’s 1,000-foot Astroman—never seriously contemplated El Capitan, but he knew somebody would eventually do it.</p>
